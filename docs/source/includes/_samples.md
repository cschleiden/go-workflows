# Samples

## Activity Registration

Shows to register activities, both as plain functions and on `struct`s to share state.

## Cancellation

Shows how to cancel a workflow and now to react to cancellation in workflow implementations.

## Complex Parameters

Demonstrates how to pass complex parameters to workflows and activities.

## Concurrent

Demonstrates how to run multiple activities concurrently.

## Context Propagation

Shows how to propagate context into workflows and from there to activities.

## Continue-As-New

Shows how to use `ContinueAsNew` to restart a workflow for "infinite" workflows.

## Converter

Shows how to use a custom converter to convert between different types.

## Errors

Shows how to handle errors in workflows and activities.

## Retries

Demonstrates sub-workflow and activity retries.

## Queues

Shows how to queue workflows and activities to different queues and how to create workers that only listen for specific queues or specific tasks (workflows or activities).

## Scale

Simple sample with a split worker and "starter" process.

## Signal

Shows how to send and receive signals to workflow.

## Signal to a Sub-Workflow

Shows how to send signals to a sub-workflows.

## Simple

Simple end-to-end sample with a single activity.

## Simple (Split Worker)

Same as the simple example, but with a split worker and "starter" process.

## Sub-Workflow

Shows how to implement and call a sub-workflow from a workflow.

## Timer

Shows how to use timers in workflows.

## Tracing

Shows how to use OpenTelemetry to trace workflows and activities.

## Web / Diagnostic UI

Shows how to use the Web UI to monitor workflows and activities.

## Workflow Info

Demonstrates how to access workflow execution information, including the history length, using `workflow.InstanceExecutionDetails()`. Shows how the history grows as the workflow executes activities and how this information can be used for monitoring workflow complexity and implementing custom logic.
